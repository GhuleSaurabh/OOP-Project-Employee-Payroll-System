# OOP-Project-Employee-Payroll-System
The Employee Payroll System uses OOP principles like Abstraction (Employee class), Encapsulation (private attributes), Inheritance (FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee), Polymorphism (overridden methods), and Interface (Bonus). It manages employees, calculates salaries and bonuses, and allows adding, removing, and displaying employees efficiently.
